# botbuilder-toybox-dialogs
These samples show examples of using the [botbuilder-toybox-dialogs](https://github.com/Stevenic/botbuilder-toybox/wiki/Dialogs) extensions for the JavaScript version of the [v4 Bot Builder SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js).

## Running
To run these samples first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stevenic/botbuilder-toybox.git
```

Change to the toybox director:

```bash
cd toybox
```

Install [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) and then bootstrap all dependencies:

```bash
npm install --global lerna
lerna bootstrap --hoist
```

Now change into the directory of the sample you'd like to run and execute `npm run start`. For examples ending with a `-ts` you will also need the latest TypeScript compiler installed:

```bash
npm install --global typescript
```
